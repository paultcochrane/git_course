{\large \alert{Directory structure}}

Subversion has a standardised directory structure:
\begin{description}
\item[trunk] The main development branch.  Often where the most work takes
    place.
\item[branches] Other lines of development.  Often used to work on new ideas
    and features so that development on the main branch isn't disturbed.
    Some projects work exclusively on branches and only very stable ideas
    and features make their way into the trunk.
\item[tags] Software releases often get \enquote{tagged} in order to give a
    state of development a human-friendly name.  Maintenance releases are
    sometimes developed further as a tag or a branch.
\end{description}
\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Subversion---Help!}
\linuxframe

Help for all Subversion commands is available at the command line.  One
merely needs to use \ttalert{svn help}:
\begin{lstlisting}
svn help               # shows all commands
svn help <subcommand>  # shows help for the given command
\end{lstlisting}

For example:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn help commit
commit (ci): Send changes from your working copy to the repository.
usage: commit [PATH...]

  A log message must be provided, but it can be empty.  If it is not
  given by a --message or --file option, an editor will be started.
  If any targets are (or contain) locked items, those will be
  unlocked after a successful commit.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; try --depth=files or
--depth=immediates

    \item can happen many times for one repository
    \item takes place after an \enquote{import}
    \item can also happen when no files are yet in the repository

    \item in order to see the source code of a project

\frametitle{Import a new project}
\linuxframe

Often the files for a project are already available.  Work has already taken
place on the project, but it isn't yet in version control.  For example,
this could be a software project to print \enquote{Hello world} to the
console.

Download the source files for the \enquote{hallo} project:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ wget http://host.name/course_material/svn_git/hallo.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf hallo.tar.gz
\end{lstlisting}

Here is a list of the files:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ ls hallo/
hallo.c  Makefile
\end{lstlisting}

One makes a new repository on the Subversion server with:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svnadmin create /path/to/repo
\end{lstlisting}
This is normally done by the system administrator.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Import a new project (cont.)}
\linuxframe

To import the \ttalert{hallo} project into Subversion, one uses the
\ttalert{svn import} command:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn import -m "<comment>" <directory> <repository URL>
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn import -m "Imported the hallo project" hallo/ \
    svn+ssh://vcskurs15@host.name/svnroot/userprojs/vcskurs15/hallo
Adding         hallo/hallo.c
Adding         hallo/Makefile

Committed revision 1.
\end{lstlisting}

The \ttalert{hallo} directory isn't yet a working copy.  We have only
imported the files into the repository.  In order to work on the project we
first need to check the project out from the repository with \ttalert{svn
checkout}.
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn checkout <repository URL>/<project name> <working copy name>
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Import a new project (cont.)}
\linuxframe
However, before we check out the new project, we should move the old
\ttalert{hallo} directory to one side:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ mv hallo hallo_keep
\end{lstlisting}
We do this because we want to check out the working copy with the same name
as the imported directory.

Now we can check out the working copy.
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn checkout \
  svn+ssh://vcskurs15@host.name/svnroot/userprojs/vcskurs15/hallo hallo
A    hallo/hallo.c
A    hallo/Makefile
Checked out revision 1.
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Import a new project (cont.)}
\linuxframe

Now we can check if everything worked.  The standard Linux command
\ttalert{diff} shows the differences between the imported directory and the
checked out working copy.
\begin{lstlisting}
$ diff hallo hallo_keep
Only in hallo: .svn
\end{lstlisting}

The \ttalert{.svn} directory is a hidden directory (In Unix, directories
with names beginning with a dot are not normally shown.) where Subversion
keeps various administrative files.  For example, this is where the all
files in the main version of the repository are stored so that Subversion
doesn't need to connect to the server (and therefore doesn't need to use the
network) in order to carry out some basic tasks.

Keeping things clean is a good idea, hence we can now remove the old
directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ rm -r hallo_keep
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

                feedback about your contributions.  Problems can therefore
                be found and corrected earlier.  Large commits stop others

    \frametitle{Hallo again}
    Let's play with the \ttalert{hallo} project a bit more.  However this
    time we'll work on it together.

    Check out the project: \ttalert{svn checkout}/\ttalert{svn co}
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn co svn+ssh://vcskurs15@host.name/svnroot/projects/hallo\
     hallo_gemeinsam
A    hallo_gemeinsam/hallo.c
A    hallo_gemeinsam/Makefile
Checked out revision 1.
\end{lstlisting}

The standard Subversion directory structure doesn't yet exist in this case.
One of us can create these directories:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn mkdir trunk branches tags
A         trunk
A         branches
A         tags
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Hallo again (cont.)}
    \linuxframe
    Show the status of the working copy:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn status
A      trunk
A      branches
A      tags
\end{lstlisting}

Now we can move the files into the \ttalert{trunk} directory:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn mv hallo.c trunk/
A         trunk/hallo.c
D         hallo.c
$ svn mv Makefile trunk/
A         trunk/Makefile
D         Makefile
\end{lstlisting}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Hallo again (cont.)}
    \linuxframe
    The status in the working copy is now more interesting:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn st
D      hallo.c
A      trunk
A  +   trunk/hallo.c
A  +   trunk/Makefile
A      branches
D      Makefile
A      tags
\end{lstlisting}

    Points of note:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Creating directories is a process in Subversion, not only from the OS
        \item A \enquote{move} of a file creates the file first at the new location
            and then deletes the old location
        \item The history of a file or directory comes with the file to its new
            location.  This was a huge improvement over CVS.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Hallo again (cont.)}
    \linuxframe
    The changes can be checked in:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn ci
Deleting       Makefile
Adding         branches
Deleting       hallo.c
Adding         tags
Adding         trunk
Adding         trunk/Makefile
Adding         trunk/hallo.c

Committed revision 2.
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Hallo again (cont.)}
    \linuxframe

    Now everyone can update their working copy to the latest version:
    \ttalert{svn update}/\ttalert{svn up}.

    \begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn up
D    hallo.c
D    Makefile
A    trunk
A    trunk/hallo.c
A    trunk/Makefile
A    branches
A    tags
Updated to revision 2.
\end{lstlisting}

    Again Subversion shows us what it's doing:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \ttalert{hallo.c} and \ttalert{Makefile} files were
            deleted from the current directory (\ttalert{D})
        \item The \ttalert{trunk}, \ttalert{branches} and \ttalert{tags}
            directories were created (added) (\ttalert{A})
        \item And the \ttalert{hallo.c} and \ttalert{Makefile} files were
            added to the \ttalert{trunk} directory (\ttalert{A}).
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Hallo again (cont.)}
    \linuxframe

We want to have a list of things that we want to add to the \ttalert{hallo}
project.  Therefore we create a file called \ttalert{TODO}:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ cd trunk/
$ echo "# TODO list for the hallo project" > TODO
$ svn status
?      TODO
\end{lstlisting}

Subversion doesn't yet know about this file.  This is why a question mark
shows up in the first (left-most) column.

In order that Subversion knows about the new file, we need to \emph{add} the
file:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn add TODO
A         TODO
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Hallo again (cont.)}
    \linuxframe

    The addition of the file to Subversion is also a \emph{change},
    therefore we need to check in (commit) this:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn ci -m "Added a TODO list" TODO 
Adding         TODO
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 3.
\end{lstlisting}

Now we can add ideas to our TODO list:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ cat TODO
# TODO list for the hallo project
 - hallo in different languages
 - say "hallo" many times
\end{lstlisting}

Now look at the status
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn st
M      TODO
\end{lstlisting}
The file has been changed, which is why a \ttalert{M} appears in the first
column.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fixing errors}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{When errors occur\ldots}
    There are many things which can happen daily which aren't necessarily
    wished for.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item one deletes a file by mistake
        \item one makes changes which are no longer relevant
        \item one makes a commit which contained an error
    \end{itemize}
    With version control it's possible to solve such problems very easily.

    In Subversion one solves such problems like so:

    \frametitle{When errors occur\ldots (cont.)}
    \linuxframe
    \vspace*{-3mm}
    \begin{alertblock}{The mistakenly deleted file}
        The solutions: \ttalert{svn update} or \ttalert{svn revert}

        An \ttalert{update} retrieves the current version of the file from
        the \ttalert{HEAD} revision on the server.
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ rm hallo.c   # oops!
$ svn up       # this would work with 'svn revert' as well
Restored 'hallo.c'
At revision 6.
$ ls           # it's there again!
hallo.c  Makefile
\end{lstlisting}

    Or a little bit worse, if one had used Subversion to delete the file:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn rm hallo.c   # oops!
D         hallo.c
$ svn revert hallo.c
Restored 'hallo.c'

        The solution: one does a \enquote{rollback}.

        There are several ways to do a \enquote{rollback}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \ttalert{svn up -r N}; \ttalert{cp file file.fixed};
                \ttalert{svn up};\\
                \ttalert{cp file.fixed file}; \ttalert{svn ci}
            \item \ttalert{svn di -r NEW:OLD > change.patch};\\
                \ttalert{patch -p0 < change.patch}; \ttalert{svn ci}
            \item \ttalert{svn merge -r NEW:OLD <URL>} or
                \ttalert{svn merge -c -NEW <URL>}; then
                \ttalert{svn ci}.  This works with Subversion Version 1.5+.
                See also \hyperlink{branch-merge}{\alert{Branching and
                Merging}} later.

    \frametitle{Conflicts}
        When one works with others it is possible that one edits the same
        part of a document as someone else.  When both of these changes are
        checked in they can't be merged automatically: one of them will be
        \emph{in conflict} with the other.  This is a disadvantage of the
        simultaneous editing model, however the advantages are most
        certainly in the majority.

        In order to resovle conflicts one needs a human (since the computer
        can't do it itself) and one needs communication between the humans.
        Subversion also gives some help in solving conflicts: the
        conflicting parts of the document are marked and one can use the
        \ttalert{svn resolved} command to mark conflicts as being corrected.

        Let's try and create a conflict within the \ttalert{hallo} project.

        We have to working copies, \ttalert{hallo1} and \ttalert{hallo2}.
\end{frame}

Exactly!

That's why one should often run \ttalert{svn update} when one works,
especially before one checks something in.  However, this won't help in this

    We need to edit the file and decide which changes need to be used.  This

    developers :-).  It can happen that the changes which need to occur
    aren't obvious, and thus one needs to discuss the situation with the
    other person who wrote the code with which yours conflicts.

    In the current case we want to use the New Zealand version and not the
    Australian one.

    However, the file still can't be committed:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn ci
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Aborting commit: '/home/cochrane/hallo1/trunk/hallo.c' remains in conflict
\end{lstlisting}

    We need to tell Subversion that the conflict has been resolved:\\
    \ttalert{svn resolved <filename>}.
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn resolved hallo.c
Resolved conflicted state of 'hallo.c'

    There is now nothing to commit (in this case) because the working copy
    version is the same as that in the repository.

    \end{itemize}

    All of these questions are answered with Subversion properties.
    Subversion can not only administer the changes in your files but also
    the properties of files and directories.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Properties---Ignoring files}
    Automatically generated files normally shouldn't be kept under version
    control.  For example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Object files, libraries and programs: \ttalert{*.o},
            \ttalert{*.so}, \ttalert{hallo} etc.
        \item \LaTeX{}'s automatically generated files: \ttalert{*.log},
            \ttalert{*.aux}, \ttalert{*.toc}, \ttalert{*.dvi}
        \item Backup files from editors: \ttalert{*\~}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Properties---Ignoring files}
    \linuxframe
    Let's return to the \ttalert{hallo} project: when the program is
    compiled an object file (\ttalert{*.o}) is created.
\begin{lstlisting}
$ ls
hallo  hallo.c  hallo.c~  hallo.o  Makefile  Makefile~  TODO
\end{lstlisting}

    \ttalert{svn status} shows us the files Subversion doesn't know about
\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn st
?      hallo
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Properties---Ignoring files (cont.)}
    \linuxframe

    Subversion automatically recognises that the \ttalert{*\~} and
    \ttalert{*.o} files can be ignored (they are standard automatically
    generated files) and thus doesn't show them in the \ttalert{svn status}
    output.  Hoewever the \ttalert{hallo} program executable file is shown
    with a question mark in the first column.  This tells us that the file
    is not yet known to Subversion.

    In order to ignore files in a directory, we need to set the
    \ttalert{svn:ignore} property of that directory appropriately.  The
    command to edit a property is:

    \ttalert{svn propedit <property> <directory/file>}

\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn propedit svn:ignore .
Set new value for property 'svn:ignore' on '.'
\end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Properties---Ignoring files (cont.)}
    \linuxframe

    Naturally this property needs to be committed to the repository.  It
    could be, however, that the repository had been changed between us
    setting the property and wanting to commit the property and therefore we
    need to run \ttalert{svn update} just in case.  Otherwise, we would get
    the following error:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn ci -m "Ignoring automatically generated files"
Sending        trunk
svn: Commit failed (details follow):
svn: Directory '/trunk' is out of date
\end{lstlisting}

    As already mentioned, Subversion also administers the properties of
    files and directories.  This means that we can also \ttalert{svn diff} a
    directory:
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\tiny\ttfamily\color{black}]
$ svn di -c 9

Property changes on: .

    This is a standard \ttalert{svn diff} output, with \ttalert{+} where

    \begin{itemize}
        \item When the \ttalert{hallo} program is compiled, an executable file called
            \ttalert{hallo} is created.
        \item This file is automatically generated; we don't want this file
            kept under version control.
        \item The file is as yet unknown to Subversion; it turns up in
            Windows Explorer with a blue question mark on its icon:

    On Linux, Windows text files contain a \ttalert{\^{}M} character at the

\begin{lstlisting}

    \frametitle{Properties---Executable files}
    \linuxframe

    Perl, Python, Shell (etc.) scripts are often directly executable.
    One can set this behaviour in Unix with the \ttalert{chmod} command.
    Subversion, however, still sees these files as text files.
    Nevertheless, one would like these files to be executable even when the
    working copy is freshly checked out.  Therefore one sets the
    \ttalert{svn:executable} property on such files.

    \ttalert{svn propset svn:executable <on/off> <filename>}

\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn ps svn:executable on hallo.pl 
property 'svn:executable' set on 'hallo.pl'
$ ls -l hallo.pl

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Properties---Binary files}
    \linuxframe

    Usually Subversion notices correctly whether or not a file contains
    plain text or binary data.  Sometimes it doesn't get this right.  PDF
    files are a common example.  In this case one can explicitly set the
    \ttalert{svn:mime-type} property.

\ttalert{svn propset svn:mime-type <MIME description>}

\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn add hallo.png hallo.svg hallo.pdf
A  (bin)  hallo.png
A         hallo.svg
A         hallo.pdf
\end{lstlisting}

    In this case we want the PDF file to be kept under version control (the
    file will be changed at some stage and the history of these changes is
    important to us) however Subversion didn't (automatically) notice that
    the file contains binary data.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Properties---Binary files}

    Hence we need to set the \ttalert{svn:mime-type} property:

property 'svn:mime-type' set on 'hallo.pdf'
$ svn ci

    checked in.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Properties---Automatic keywords}
    \linuxframe

    In some software development projects it is common practice that each
    file contain the author, revision and date of the last change to the
    file.  This can be set automatically in Subversion via certain keywords
    and the use of the \ttalert{svn:keywords} property.

    Let's add the following lines to \ttalert{hallo.c}:
\begin{lstlisting}
// $Id$
// $Author$
// $Revision$
// $Date$
\end{lstlisting}
    This doesn't change anything for Subversion (other than that the file
    has now been changed).  CVS, however, interprets these lines straight
    away; sometimes this isn't what one wants!  In Subversion, when one
    wants to use these keywords, one needs to activate the
    \ttalert{svn:keywords} property.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ svn ps svn:keywords "Author Revision Date" hallo.c
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'hallo.c'

    Where is the keyword for \ttalert{Id}?  This wasn't set and is therefore
    not expanded.  To be honest, in most cases the \ttalert{Id} keyword is
    all that is needed, since this is a simply a compact version containing
    the other keywords mentioned above.

    \frametitle{Branches, Tags and Merging}

    One of the most powerful features of version control systems is the
    possibility to have multiple parallel development directions and to be
    able to manage them all within the one system.

    For example:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Feature branches:] for the development of new features
            \begin{itemize}
                \item don't disturb other lines of development
                \item one can see the changes which take place and give
                    feedback
                \item usually only have a short lifespan
            \end{itemize}
        \item[Maintenance branches:] long term maintenance of software
        \begin{itemize}
            \item bugs (found and corrected in the maintenance branch)
                can be merged with trunk
            \item bugs (found and corrected in trunk) can be merged into
                the maintenance branch
            \item are not as static as a tag (from the human point of view)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{description}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Branches, Tags and Merging (cont.)}
    How one uses branches is basically a question of project policy.  For
    example:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Branches are \enquote{stable}; trunk is only for development
        \item Trunk is \enquote{stable}; branches are only for development
    \end{itemize}

    In Subversion, new branches are created via a copy operation:

    \ttalert{svn copy <source url> <target url> -m "<comment>"}

    This only happens on the server; one then merely needs to check out the
    new branch via either \ttalert{svn checkout} or \ttalert{svn update}.

    \begin{alertblock}{Tags}

        Tags are basically only things for people.  The operation in
        Subversion is identical to creation of a branch, the difference is
        in how a human being considers a tag or a branch (tags, branches and
        trunk are really just directories).  A branch is more often seen as
        something which has a limited lifetime, since the development will
        flow back into the trunk at some point (at which point the branch
        ends) or the development is seen as unnecessary and stops.  A tag is
        often used for \enquote{software releases} (e.g.~version 0.1, 0.2
        etc.) and is therefore much more permanent.

    \begin{alertblock}{Merging}
        When the main development happens in trunk and branches are
        \enquote{feature branches}, then it's a good idea that when one
        works on a branch, that the latest changes from trunk are
        periodically \enquote{merged} into your branch.  This reduces the
        risk that the branch development wanders too far away from the trunk
        development which would cause difficulties when the branch is to be
        merged back into the trunk at some later time.

        Since version 1.5, Subversion remembers which merges from trunk have
        already happened and so only pulls in the latest changes when the
        next merge takes place.  This is important when a branch is to be
        merged back into trunk: the previous changes on trunk shouldn't be
        played back onto the trunk!

\frametitle{Changing a repository's name}

Sometimes one wants to change the name of the repository as it no longer
properly reflects its purpose anymore.  To do this the administrator of the
Subversion repository merely needs to change the name of the base directory
containing the repository:
\begin{lstlisting}
cd /svnroot/...
mv <oldreponame> <newreponame>
\end{lstlisting}

The users now need to update their working copies.  They do this with the
\ttalert{svn switch} command:
\begin{lstlisting}
svn switch --relocate <old_repo_url> <new_repo_url>
\end{lstlisting}

For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
svn switch --relocate \
    svn+ssh://vcskurs15@host.name/svnroot/projects/hallo \
    svn+ssh://vcskurs15@host.name/svnroot/projects/moin
