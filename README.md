# Version Control Course

Various courses on the topic of source code version control, focussing
mainly on [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

## Git Intro

In the `git_intro` directory.

The most up to date of our version control courses.  This is a completely
reworked version of the Git part of the "Subversion and Git" course.

## Version Control with Subversion and Git

In the `svn_git` directory.

This is the original course on Subversion and Git held at the Regional
Computing Centre for Lower Saxony in Hannover and is kept in the repository
merely for historical/archival reasons.
